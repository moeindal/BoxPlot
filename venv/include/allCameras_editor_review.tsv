No manual exposure controls; slightly soft images.	If you need a camera that you can take snorkeling or skiing, then the Stylus 790 SW might be just the ticket, but you can find better image quality elsewhere for the same price.

No manual exposure controls, slightly sluggish performance.	Canon's SD950 IS looks great and can take very nice images, but the digital camera's whopping 12 megapixels will leave you waiting between shots.

Noisy images at higher ISOs; no place to put your thumb.	If you don't like electronic viewfinders, but want a superzoom, this Sony packs a 10x zoom lens and 8 megapixels into a tiny package, but image quality at higher ISOs is a bit lacking.
32471270	Overall score: 7.8 (3.5 stars)	$572.00	{'performance': 7.0, 'design': 8.0, 'features': 8.0, 'image quality': 8.0}	Philip Ryan	Great image quality at lower ISOs; manual exposure controls; quick nonflash performance.

Relatively significant distortion at the widest angle of view; when zoomed out completely, lens intrudes into viewfinder; no optical zoom during movie capture.	The Canon PowerShot G9 is a solid enthusiast digital camera for those who want something compact to complement a dSLR.

Horrible noise; really small zoom rocker.	If not for the massive amounts of noise in some photos, the HP Photosmart R937 would be a good point-and-shoot camera.
32475696	Overall score: 6.2 (3.0 stars)	$429.00	{}	Philip Ryan	Quick performance; comfortable design.	Terrible noise, lens distortion.	Great performance and solid design can't get past the HP Photosmart R847's major image deficiencies.

Awkward, occasionally frustrating design; eccentric Wi-Fi feature set.	An overpriced, overweight, and oddball camera, the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-G1 takes decent photos, but its ancillary features--Wi-Fi and MP3 playback--aren't usefully implemented.
32411777	Overall score: 6.0 (3.0 stars)	$153.00	{'performance': 5.0, 'design': 7.0, 'features': 7.0, 'image quality': 4.0}	Philip Ryan	Manual exposure controls; face-detection features are useful.	Slow to shoot; photos are filled with noise at all but the lowest sensitivity settings; face detection is unreliable in low light.	The 10-megapixel Samsung S1050 has lots of neat features, but its photos come up lacking.

No manual exposure controls; no optical viewfinder.	While the Canon PowerShot SD870 IS doesn't have an optical viewfinder or manual exposure controls, it captures beautiful images with its wide, 3.8x optical zoom lens and ranks among the top compact cameras we've seen.

Sluggish; noise issues at ISO 800 and above.	While it suffers at higher ISO sensitivity settings, the Kodak EasyShare Z885 is a surprisingly flexible, affordable camera.
32412495	Overall score: 7.2 (3.5 stars)		{'performance': 7.0, 'design': 7.0, 'features': 8.0, 'image quality': 7.0}		Has 12x optical zoom; optical image stabilization; manual exposure controls.	Noticeable fringing and artifacts in images; noisy images at ISO 800 and ISO 1,600	Kodak's EasyShare Z712 IS is a nice superzoom, especially for the price, though its image quality does falter at higher ISOs.
32401522	Overall score: 6.4 (3.0 stars)	$179.00	{'performance': 6.0, 'design': 7.0, 'features': 6.0, 'image quality': 6.0}	Philip Ryan	Nice photos; decent performance for a budget camera; face detection.

Noisy images above ISO 400; sluggish shot-to-shot and startup-to-first-shot times.	If you absolutely must have a 12-megapixel compact camera, the DMC-FX100 isn't a bad choice, but you can find better performing cameras with lower pixel counts for the same money.

Slow performance overall; overly noisy images at ISO 800 and ISO 1600; poor control scheme; inelegant design and ergonomics.	Sigma and Foveon fans, who have been waiting eagerly for this camera, might be interested in the SD14, but consumers can easily find more bang for their buck from other SLRs on the market.
31965083	Overall score: 6.8 (3.0 stars)	$432.59	{'performance': 6.0, 'design': 7.0, 'features': 7.0, 'image quality': 6.0}	Lori Grunin	Long zoom for its size; pause during movie capture; voice notes.	No optical viewfinder; LCD washes out and has narrow viewing angle; all-around noisy photos with poor white balance; camera automatically mutes audio while zooming in movies.	The Samsung NV7 OPS' novel, engaging interface can't compensate for merely adequate performance and so-so photo quality.
32329614	Overall score: 7.2 (3.5 stars)	$1,349.99	{'performance': 7.0, 'design': 7.0, 'features': 8.0, 'image quality': 7.0}	Lori Grunin	Relatively wide angle for a megazoom; tons of manual and automatic features; large, flip-up LCD; fast continuous shooting.	Small EVF; lens aberrations and vignetting; image noise and some processing artifacts; lacks hotshoe and raw file support.	If you shoot primarily outdoors in daytime--especially sports, children and animals--the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-H9 is a great choice. The cheaper DSC-H7 has a smaller LCD, lacks infrared shooting, and has a few interface differences, but is otherwise identical.
32401643	Overall score: 6.2 (3.0 stars)	$369.99	{'performance': 5.0, 'design': 6.0, 'features': 7.0, 'image quality': 7.0}	Lori Grunin	Low-noise, higher-ISO photos; broad set of manual controls; optical zoom operates in movie mode; runs on AA batteries.	Frustrating design; sluggish performance; no optical image stabilization.	The Fujifilm FinePix S700 would be a nice budget megazoom if it weren't hampered by mediocre performance and a frustrating design.
32441341	Overall score: 7.4 (3.5 stars)	$669.00	{'performance': 7.0, 'design': 8.0, 'features': 8.0, 'image quality': 7.0}	Lori Grunin	Tons of manual and automatic features; well-laid-out controls; solid body; nice LCD display.	Lens aberrations and vignetting; some processing artifacts; lacks raw file support; redesigned lens cap still pops off too easily.	Though it remains a good megazoom, thanks to continued image and lens artifacts, the Canon PowerShot S5 IS is slowly losing ground to competitors.
32343637	Overall score: 7.2 (3.5 stars)	$34.95	{'performance': 7.0, 'design': 7.0, 'features': 7.0, 'image quality': 8.0}		Very nice image quality at lower ISOs; effective face detection.	No optical or mechanical image stabilization; slightly sluggish performance; no aperture-priority or shutter-priority modes.	Fuji's FinePix F40fd is a nice point-and-shoot that produces decent images, though it's a tad slow and lacks image stabilization.

Slow performance; noisy, fringe-filled photos; touch screen interface is a pain.	A wide lens and nifty tour guide feature simply can't redeem the Samsung L74 Wide from its poor image quality, slow shooting, and irritating interface.

Requires far more light for low ISO shots than most competitors; exceptionally long flash-recycle time and disappointing shot-to-shot performance; image-processing artifacts; LCD has poor off-angle viewing; proprietary USB cable.	The Sony Cyber-shot DSC-W200's 12-megapixel sensor raises the price of an otherwise decent snapshot camera, with little benefit. The W90 and W80 are better deals.
32306190	Overall score: 7.0 (3.5 stars)	$176.97	{'performance': 6.0, 'design': 7.0, 'features': 8.0, 'image quality': 7.0}	Philip Ryan	Manual exposure and focus controls; quick shutter speed.	Sluggish shot-to-shot time; tends to underexpose lamp-lit shots; awkward manual focus	As one of the least expensive cameras with manual exposure controls out there, the Samsung S850 is a great choice for photography newbies.

The lack of a built-in browser prevents you from being able to access most free public Wi-Fi access points.	While it takes good pictures and it's nice to be able to access private Wi-Fi access points, the lack of a browser keeps this camera from rising to the next level.

Slightly sluggish AF system; low effective resolution for a pro-level camera; bloated file sizes.	While a wide dynamic range lets it serve up tons of highlight detail and impressive overall image quality, the S5 Pro isn't for high-speed sports photography, and it could use more resolution.

Sluggish performance; no xD-Picture Card included; soft photos.	This Olympus SP-350 is packed with powerful manual features, but its performance and photo quality lag behind the competition's.
31511452	Overall score: 6.6 (3.0 stars)		{}	Lori Grunin	Simple operation; excellent photo quality; long 5X zoom for such a compact package.	Slow operation; few manual controls; too expensive for what you get.	The Nikon Coolpix L1 is a bare-bones camera with slow operation but very good image quality that will please casual snapshooters.

Few manual controls; limited shutter-speed range; movie clips at only 15fps.	The Nikon Coolpix S4 resurrects the company's classic swivel-lens design with modern touches, including lots of scene modes and in-camera fixes for common problems. Image quality and performance seem a bit old-fashioned, however.
31470099	Overall score: 6.3 (3.0 stars)	$139.99	{}	Lori Grunin	Broad feature set for its class; image stabilization; multiple custom functions; speedy burst mode.	Pricey for a 5-megapixel camera; trouble handling highlights; various problems with photo quality.	The Kodak EasyShare P850 has an amazing array of features, but mediocre photo quality mitigates its appeal.

No manual controls; slow autofocus; long shutter lag; LCD difficult to view in bright light; motion-picture clips limited to 320x240.	The Olympus FE-120 offers decent 6-megapixel picture quality and a capable burst mode, but its lack of manual controls makes it strictly a snapshooter's mainstay.
31511364	Overall score: 6.8 (3.0 stars)	$499.99	{}	Lori Grunin	Wi-Fi transfer and printing; very good image quality; many customizable image parameters.	Sluggish performance; limited manual-exposure control; can't e-mail images or post them to the Web via Wi-Fi.	The Nikon Coolpix P1's good image quality offsets its novel but limited Wi-Fi capabilities.

Overall build quality and performance typical of much cheaper cameras; no constant ISO display; images show occasional red fringing around highlight transitions; automatic white balance occasionally inconsistent.	A decent midrange digital SLR camera built around a superb sensor, the Canon EOS 5D delivers great images and the familiar 35mm-film-format shooting experience for a comparatively low (though still hefty) price.
31355774	Overall score: 6.4 (3.0 stars)	$204.99	{}	Aimee Baldridge	Competitively priced; capable of producing relatively high-quality photos; easy-to-navigate onscreen menus; integration with EasyShare software and dock system.

Subpar EVF; less-than-stellar photo quality; movie mode downgraded to 320x240 resolution.	Compact and affordable, the image-stabilized megazoom Konica Minolta Dimage Z6 delivers a solid feature set. Finicky photographers may take issue with its image quality, though.
31475444	Overall score: 7.4 (3.5 stars)	$420.00	{'performance': 8.0, 'design': 7.0, 'features': 6.0, 'image quality': 6.0}	Aimee Baldridge	Ultracompact design; long battery life; excellent burst capabilities; low shutter lag; versatile movie mode.

Expensive; large and heavy; requires high-capacity memory cards.	Canon's EOS 1Ds Mark II offers a wealth of features and the highest resolution of any small-format digital SLR, with a price to match.
31516360	Overall score: 7.7 (3.5 stars)	$9.00	{'performance': 7.0, 'design': 8.0, 'features': 8.0, 'image quality': 8.0}	Lori Grunin	Excellent image quality; an impressively flexible LCD screen that's viewable from many angles; a sharp Zeiss lens; effective white-balancing features; a wide range of ISO sensitivity; quick performance.	With most heavy components on the left side, the chunky body is somewhat off-balance; can't shoot raw in burst mode; the in-camera review function magnifies to only 5X.	If you don't anticipate a need for multiple lenses--which many users won't, given the crisp 24mm-to-120mm-equivalent lens with a maximum aperture of f/2.8--the Sony Cyber Shot DSC-R1 makes a worthy competitor to the dSLRs in its price range. It's a handy, versatile camera with excellent image quality.

31396069			{}		Sleek, attractive design; bundled dock for easy image transfer; useful selection of scene modes; in-camera help; above-average continuous-shooting speed.	A tendency to clip highlights; low battery life; mixed image quality.	This slick little camera (and its even slicker dock) makes short work of the entire picture-taking process but doesn't soar above the crowd in image quality.
31292842	Overall score: 6.6 (3.0 stars)	$299.99	{}	Aimee Baldridge	Compact design; fast response times; two continuous-shooting modes; strong battery life.	Small LCD screen; limited manual settings; photos exhibit a slight softness; wrist-strap hook gets in the way.	Less expensive than the flagship Cyber Shot DSC-S90 but sharing many of its features and capabilities, the entry-level Sony Cyber Shot DSC-S40 provides a good value in a point-and-shoot camera.
